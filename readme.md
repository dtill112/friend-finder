Friend-Finder Homework

*Friend-Finder is an application using HTML, JS, Express, Node and other systems which serves the purpose of linking up you with others that have similar interestws.

*On the front end, a user opens the application, enters their name, a picture of themselves and then answers 10 questions that are designed to align you with other likeminded people.

*After you enter your personal information, the data is moved to the node server where all other user information is stored. 

*The application then looks at how you answered each of the questions and gives you a "score". The score is not an assessent of accomplishment on the survey, but rather it matches the scores of each individual question that you answered and matches it most closely with the answers of other users. The program loops through this process until each question is examined and matched.

*Following this process, a modal will appear on the screen with a potential companion who it believes will best suite you as a friend or companion.
